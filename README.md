# Machine Learning Summary
This is a summary of the most import topics regarding machine learning. I assume some basic knoledge about linear algebra and statistics, but don't worry there's nothing to fear. In the future I will write some introductory chapters about these topics. This work is based on the Polimi course "MACHINE LEARNING(097683)".
