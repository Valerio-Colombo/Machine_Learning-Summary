## How to Contribute

To contribute to this project, you'll need to have a few tools installed on your machine:

1. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download): This is the editor we'll be using.
2. [LaTeX Workshop](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=James-Yu.latex-workshop): This is a Visual Studio Code extension that provides comprehensive LaTeX support.
3. [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/download): This is a distribution of the LaTeX typesetting system (both for Windows and Unix systems). There are also other distributions like [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/), but I recommend MiKTeX.

Once you have these installed, follow these steps:

1. **Fork and clone the repository**: First, create a fork of the repository on GitHub. Then, clone your forked repository to your local machine.
2. **Open the project in Visual Studio Code**: Navigate to the cloned repository on your machine and open it in Visual Studio Code.
3. **Install the LaTeX Workshop extension**: If you haven't already, install the LaTeX Workshop extension in Visual Studio Code.
4. **Configure LaTeX Workshop to use MiKTeX**: In the settings of LaTeX Workshop (File > Preferences > Settings), search for "LaTeX Workshop > TeX Path" and set it to the path of your MiKTeX installation.
5. **Make your changes**: Now you're ready to make your changes to the project. Use Visual Studio Code and LaTeX Workshop to edit the LaTeX files.
6. **Build the project**: By default the build happens each time you save a file. You can also build the project by opening the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P), typing "LaTeX Workshop: Build LaTeX project", and pressing Enter. 
7. **Commit and push your changes**: Once you're happy with your changes, commit them to your local repository and push them to your forked repository on GitHub.
8. **Create a pull request**: Finally, go to your forked repository on GitHub and create a pull request. This will notify the maintainers of the project, who can then review your changes.
